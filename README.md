# The Harry Potter Quote Bot for Reddit, by /u/anonymous853
Reddit bot for providing context to quotes found on the [Harry Potter Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter)

This is based on the US version of the series.

If you would like to verify a quote exists in this edition, feel free to navigate to data/[book number]/[chapter number] and make a search. Or download this repository, it requires only a few libraries available from pip.

#Notes

Current Settings:

If you post more than one quote in a post, the post length will be compressed so as to not take up too much space on the page.

Quotes are only accepted if they have five or more words.

Answers are only from the first time they show up in the series, to keep post length down.
